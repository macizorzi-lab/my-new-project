#AI in the medic filed

Final project for the Building AI course

# Summary

An AI that helps medicine student to find answers resumes and other usefull documentation for the reserch or study they are doing

## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* a lot of data tu archive and to update regurarly
* built an AI good enough to understand the problem (even from photos or files) and give a detailed answer with specific therms and definitions
* being able to recognize from photo or video what the problem is and analyizing it
* having a lot of data do confrot with


## How is it used?

everyone in the medical field will be able to use it to serach symptoms and what to prescribe, it can analyze photo the client sends and verify wihitn its data what the problem is (infection, cut, tissue to see if it has any cancer or its developing one, ecc.), it will be a very usefull tool that will help giving an anwer faster or to help doctorn and nurse to find a problem thay might not see


This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

the limitation of my project is the accuracy of AI, a doctor or anyone else that works with human lives in the medical field can't trust the AI 100% of the time it will always have a marign of error so it can be used to do a faster job and see things u might miss but always double chack what it tells becouse it could not be right.

## What next?

it could grow by feeding it with more data for example if doctor starts using it and feeding it with data it could get more accurate, and it can get reviewd from doctor to have a better chance to get it right the next time.
